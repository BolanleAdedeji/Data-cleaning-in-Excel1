### Project Overview 

Welcome to my Excel Data, where I tackle messy datasets head-on! This project showcases my expertise in transforming raw, inconsistent, and error-prone data into a clean, structured, and ready-for-analysis format.

Whether you're a recruiter looking for a detail-oriented data analyst or a data enthusiast eager to explore the power of Excel, this repository is for you!

### Data Source
Green Data Solution

### Errors Inside
Raw Data: Real-world messy datasets filled with challenges like:

- Missing values

- Inconsistent formatting

- Duplicate entries

- Erroneous data points

### Cleaning Steps 
Step-by-step documentation of cleaning techniques, including:
- Remove duplicate data to maintain a clear dataset, reduce the chances of inconsistency in analysis, remove the chances of having incorrect conclusions.
- Trim the name column to remove unnecessary spaces before, in between and after names
- Edit the name to have proper casing, this ensures the data are uniform, reduces the chance of errors in analysis, enhances data matching, and improves searchability and readability of data.
- Unknown was found in the age column, this was identified and replaced by the mean age which is 33, mean age was achieved by calculating the average, and was replaced using 'find and replace'.
- On the gender column had both inconsistencies with how male and female were written, by using "find and replace", all male were replaced with "M" and all females were replaced with "F", there were also empty cells were identified

Cleaned Data: The polished, ready-to-analyze dataset.
Analysis Insights: Bonus visualizations and summaries created post-cleaning.

### Tools Used
#### - Microsoft Excel:
- Advanced functions,
- conditional formatting, and
- data validation.
#### - Power Query: For efficient data transformation and automation.
Pivot Tables & Charts: For quick summaries and insights.
